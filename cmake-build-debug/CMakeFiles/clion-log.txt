CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindDependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1" with any of the following names:

    Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1Config.cmake
    dependencies/glfw/glfw-3.2.1-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "Dependencies/GLFW/glfw-3.2.1"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
